## Lesson 6 – Tools & MCP (Making AI Agents Real)

In this lesson, I learned how AI agents move from just generating text to performing real-world actions using tools and standardized protocols.

### What I Learned
- Why LLMs need tools to access real-world systems
- How tool calling enables agents to use APIs, databases, and code
- Difference between traditional and embedded tool calling
- How AI-powered SQL agents translate natural language into database queries
- How MCP (Model Context Protocol) standardizes tool connections for agents

### Key Concepts
- **Tool Calling:** Lets LLMs select and use external tools
- **Embedded Tool Calling:** Improves reliability and reduces hallucination
- **SQL Agents:** Enable natural language data access
- **MCP:** Open protocol for scalable agent-tool communication

### Real Insight
This lesson showed me that:
LLMs alone can only *talk*.
Agents with tools can actually *do real work*.

This is the foundation of real-world Agentic AI systems.
