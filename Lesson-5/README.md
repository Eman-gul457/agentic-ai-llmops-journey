# Lesson 5 – Generative AI vs Agentic AI

This day focuses on understanding the difference between:
- Generative AI
- Structured workflows
- Autonomous (Agentic) AI systems

I learned these concepts from:
- 1 podcast
- 2 videos
- 1 reading from IBM Cognitive Class

## Key Concepts

### 1. Generative AI (Reactive)
Generative AI systems wait for a prompt and then generate output.

Flow:
Input → LLM → Output

Examples:
- ChatGPT
- Image generators
- Code generators

They are:
- Stateless
- Reactive
- Do not take actions on their own

---

### 2. Structured Workflows (Deterministic)
Workflows follow fixed steps defined by developers.

Flow:
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Output

Examples:
- OCR → Extract → Validate → Store
- Financial processing pipelines

They are:
- Predictable
- Easy to audit
- Good for compliance systems

But:
- Rigid
- Hard to adapt to new scenarios

---

### 3. Agentic AI (Autonomous Agents)
Agentic AI systems can plan and act.

Agent loop:
Plan → Act → Observe → Learn → Repeat

They:
- Use tools
- Have memory
- Adapt based on feedback

Examples:
- Research agents
- AutoGPT
- Personal AI assistants

---

## Main Takeaway

Generative AI answers questions.  
Agentic AI achieves goals.

Real-world systems are usually hybrid:
Workflows for reliability + Agents for intelligence.
