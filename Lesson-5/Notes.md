# Lesson 5 – Learning Notes: Workflows vs Agents

## What I thought before
Before this lesson, I thought:
AI = chatbot

I believed AI only generates text, images, or code.

## What I understand now

There are three main paradigms:

### 1. Single LLM Features
These are simple one-shot systems.

Examples:
- Summarization
- Translation
- Sentiment analysis

Characteristics:
- No memory
- No planning
- No multi-step logic

They are fast and cheap, but not intelligent.

---

### 2. Structured Workflows
These systems use LLMs inside fixed pipelines.

Example:
Insurance processing:
OCR → Extract → Validate → Store

Characteristics:
- Deterministic
- Easy to monitor
- Good for enterprise systems

Problem:
They cannot adapt or reason in new situations.

---

### 3. Autonomous Agents (Agentic AI)
These systems can:
- Plan tasks
- Use tools
- Learn from feedback
- Change strategy

They follow a loop:
Perceive → Decide → Act → Learn

This makes them:
- Context-aware
- Goal-driven
- Proactive

## Important Insight from Videos

Generative AI is reactive:
It waits for humans.

Agentic AI is proactive:
It acts like a junior employee.

---

## Real-world truth

Modern AI systems are not purely agents or workflows.

They are hybrid systems:
- Workflows provide safety and control
- Agents provide reasoning and flexibility

This is how real companies design AI today.

## Personal Reflection

This lesson changed how I see AI.

Now I understand:
The future of AI is not just chat.
The future of AI is systems that can think, plan, and act.
