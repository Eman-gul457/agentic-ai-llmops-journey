## Lesson 7 – Multi-Agent & Agentic AI


In this lesson, I explored how multiple specialized LLM agents collaborate to handle complex workflows and how autonomous agentic AI can make decisions independently. I also learned why governance is essential.

### What I Learned
- Limitations of single LLMs in multi-step tasks
- Multi-agent systems for modular, scalable AI
- Communication patterns: sequential, parallel, interactive
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate, up-to-date responses
- Difference between AI assistants (DIY) and agents (Do It For You)
- Orchestrator agents for smooth workflow management
- Governance strategies to manage autonomy risks

### Key Concepts
- **Multi-Agent LLMs:** Specialized agents handle distinct tasks
- **Communication Patterns:** Ensure coordination and clarity
- **RAG:** LLM retrieves relevant information before generating answers
- **Agentic AI:** Autonomous decision-making with risk considerations
- **Orchestrators:** Manage multiple agents and their workflows
- **Governance:** Technical safeguards, monitoring, and accountability

### Real Insight
LLMs alone can only *talk*.  
Multi-agent, agentic AI systems can *act*, *decide*, and *coordinate*, creating real-world impact—but with proper governance.
