# Lesson-2 - First AI DevOps Agent 🤖

## Goal
Build a simple AI agent that:
- Thinks about what to do
- Chooses a Linux command
- Executes it automatically

## What I Built
A Python script using:
- Ollama (local LLM)
- phi3 model
- subprocess for command execution

The agent:
1. Receives a role ("You are a DevOps agent")
2. Decides which command to run
3. Executes it on my system

## Code
File: `agent.py`

## Output

## What I Learned
- How to call a local LLM from Python
- How AI can decide actions (Agent concept)
- How to execute system commands safely
